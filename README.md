# Neural Network in JS
This small implementation of neural network is a tool for teaching non-graduated students, how computational science are inspired/sometimes maded by other branche of sciences

For portuguease readers, we have documentation files check: Relatorio Backpropagation (neural network text described algorithm) and Backpropagation.xls (step-by step using formulas)

# modified from mlp-js
A simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) demo website, coded with pure and native JavaScript.
